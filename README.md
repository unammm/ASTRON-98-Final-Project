The objective of this project has been to examine Kepler's Third Law using data from experimental observations available in the NASA Exoplanet Archive, including generating 
the constant of proportionality using python functions. NOTE: The file named final project code(3).py is the final submission code for the project! The other files are just 
there to show progress.
